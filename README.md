Course Description:
A study of fundamental methods for designing and implementing algorithms and analyzing their efficiency. While developing expertise in select models of computation and the key mathematical and experimental approaches to studying algorithm efficiency, students investigate different types of algorithms through hands-on activities that often require teamwork. Students also learn how to determine whether a problem can be efficiently solved by an algorithm that is implemented as a computer program. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations.
